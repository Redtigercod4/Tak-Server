In this case, the TAK client is configured to use TLS and a client certificate when connecting to TAK server, but does not send an authentication message. This eliminates the requirement to cache credentials on the device, or enter credentials prior to establishment of each new connection. TAK Server will then filter messages according to common group membership, in a similar fashion to input-level filtering with filter groups. When analyzing the X.509 client certificate presented by the TAK client, TAK Server will look at the DN attribute in the certificate, extract the CN value from the DN (if present). The CN is regarded as the username, and is used to look up group membership in authentication backends. For example, consider this DN in a client certificate:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/groupfiltering":{"id":"configuration/groupfiltering","title":"Group Filtering","description":"TAK Server has the ability to segment users so they only see a subset of the other users on the system.

If not otherwise specified, all connections default to being in the special \u201cANON\u201d group (note 2 underscores as prefix and postfix).

The trust-store listing the allowed CAs for the \\"User Port\\" only contains a single CA (i.e. Enclave 1 CA for Enclave 1).  To federate the servers, Enclave 1 and Enclave 2 send each other the \\"public\\" CA cert.  Those certificates are put in a separate trust store that is used only for federation connections.

To create an outgoing connection, click on the corresponding link, and enter in the address and port of the destination server.

One of the key components to how TAK Server satisfies all the restrictions is that we use one trust-store for local users, and one for Federates.  The trust-store contains all the valid CAs that you will allow client certificates from.  By having separate trust-stores, we can have the Federation channels allow connections with certificates from \u201coutside\u201d CAs, while not allowing ATAKs with certs from those \u201coutside\u201d CAs to make direct connections to our server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"firewall/overview":{"id":"firewall/overview","title":"Overview","description":"One of the most common problems people have is the system default firewall blocking their traffic.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"firewall/rhelrockycentos":{"id":"firewall/rhelrockycentos","title":"RHEL, Rocky Linux, and CentOS","description":"To verify whether a firewall is running, use the command:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"firewall/ubunturaspberrypi":{"id":"firewall/ubunturaspberrypi","title":"Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi","description":"UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a utility for managing firewalls.
